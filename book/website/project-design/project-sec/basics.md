# Security basics

When planning a project where we're developing software we should aim to think
about security from the very start and try to think about security at each stage
of our project.

When starting to plan a project and defining your requirements you should
consider whether there will be security requirements for the software you're
writing. Does it involve data that is confidential? Is it going to be run by
multiple different users?

What third party packages/libraries will you be using? Are these suitably well
maintained or verified as secure? These are often what is being considered when
we discuss ideas around supply chain security.

When writing code how do we make sure we avoid writing potential security
vulnerabilities. 

How do we verify our application is secure? 

How do we ensure we deploy our application securely and communicate this to
users?
