# Project Security

## Prerequisites

None

## Summary

In this chapter, we explore a range of considerations when planning a project
with regard to project security. When we start designing a project its often
easy to overlook thinking about the security of our project. Considering
security from the start of a project can help not just keep us safe but also
make it easier to deploy and share our code in a secure manner. 

This chapter specifically looks at the security of software we write, it will
touch on ideas around security of data but for a more detailed look at data
security please check the [Managing Sensitive Data Projects Chapter](./sdpm.md).

Topics covered in this chapter:

- [Security Basics](project-sec/basics.md)
- [Managing secrets](project-sec/secrets.md)
- 
## Motivation

Researchers who write software as part of their research often don't consider
security until they are forced too. This is because software security is a
complicated topic that often isn't easily accessible for researchers. This
chapter aims to accessibly introduce the topic of software security and provide
some initial guidance for planning a secure project.
